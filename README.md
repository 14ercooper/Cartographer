# Cartographer
Cartographer is a collection of datapacks for Minecraft 1.16 that add custom enchantments, mob attacks, and more, for use in CTM maps.

Each folder above is a separate datapack which can be dropped into a Minecraft world's "datapack" folder. Once placed inside the datapack folder, and the world has been reloaded, they will add new features to the game.

The current existing modules are:

**Custom Enchantments** - An addition of over 20 new Enchantments that can be added to weapons, tools, and armor.

**Custom Statuses** - Additional status effects which can be used on mobs. Currently unfinished, but used by the Custom Enchantments pack.

**Mimics** - Adds a new mob type to the game: The Mimic. Mimics disguise themselves as chests and attack unsuspecting victims when opened.

**Mob Abilities** - An addition of over 20 new custom ability attacks which can be given to all hostile mobs. Includes active telegraphed attacks with fancy particles, passive traits that can be applied to mobs, and traits that trigger when a mob dies.

**Repair Stations** - Adds a structure which can be spawned in world which serves as an alternative to anvils. It can repair gear with increasing and controllable costs, and protects gear lost from durability destroying it.
