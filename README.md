# Cartographer
Cartographer is a collection of datapacks for Minecraft 1.16 that add custom enchantments, mob attacks, and more, for use in CTM maps.

Each folder above is a separate datapack which can be dropped into a Minecraft world's "datapack" folder. Once placed inside the datapack folder, and the world has been reloaded, they will add new features to the game.

There are a large quantity of available modules to use! Information on what each adds can be found at the github wiki linked below.

To get started, you can refer to the documentation wiki for Cartographer, which can be found here.

If you have any further questions not covered by the wiki, or suggestions for the datapack, you can find me on Twitter (@PearUhDox) and on Discord (PearUhDox#0002).
