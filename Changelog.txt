Cartographer, Patch 2020.11.0 - Divine Additions

Alright lets start out with the announcements!

First, I am no longer considering Cartographer in open beta! Any beta versions of Cartographer will be marked accordingly on github.

There's a slight change to my naming format which might be a tad confusing, but the overall patch is going to go "Year.Month.Hotfix". So welcome to 2020.11.0!
Individual modules will be named with version counts (V1.0 / V1.1 etc). This is to hopefully avoid confusion with modules of "version 1.0" but a patch of a later date.

Cartographer is also updating to 1.16.3 and higher. Piglin Brutes have been added to all hostile tags necessary.
This means the datapack will no longer work in versions before 1.16.2. Sorry anyone who was using those versions!

We're moving up due to complications with security in 1.16.1. Additionally, the upcoming project I'm leading (more below) is going to be a 1.16.4 release!

Now onto the update itself.

This is an update to prepare Cartographer for use in an upcoming project I've been proud to help lead. As the first major map to use Cartographer, this is super exciting!
A lot of these changes are being made with the balance of that project in mind, but also to improve features across the board.

What's that new project? Well I'm not just gonna say it here, but surely someone will figure it out. ;)

This doesn't mean no new content though. There are additions to Mob Abilities, Custom Statuses, and 2 new modules. (Repair Stations and Mimics)
And now lets get into the details!

Additions:

Repair Stations bring an alternative to anvils, for maps that do not want to include anvils, but still have repairable gear.
- Repair Stations can be summoned into the world with a structure block. See the wiki for more details.
- Repair Stations can only repair items with durability, and items that aren't fully repaired.
- Repair Stations will cost the user Experience Levels, Lapis Lazuli, and the material the item is made with.
- When you repair an item, its experience and lapis cost will double. (Material cost is constant)
- Items cannot be repaired over a cap. This cap is by default set to 50 Levels and 20 Lapis. If either is above the allowed threshold, the item is irreparable.
- Default starter repair cost of items with no stats is 12 Levels, 4 Lapis. This will probably change based on user feedback.

Mimics bring the stereotypical greedy player punisher to Minecraft. Warning, these Mimics aren't fooling around.
- Mimics appear as trapped chests, and are placeable via structure blocks.
- If a Mimic is opened, it will reveal itself, damaging the player for their foolishness, and stealing some of their hunger bar.
- Mimics can be broken in dormant state, or shot with an arrow. Doing so will reveal them, and do some free damage to them.
- When Mimics are threatened, they get angry. You won't like them when they're angry.
- You might be able to loot a Mimic if you're invisible, or if you have some disguise (while it is in the dormant state).
- Mapmakers can customize what loot mimics drop on death. Simply place the items in the chest in creative mode, or while the mimic is inactive.
- Mimics scale their stats based on the armor value of the player opening them. The stronger the player, the stronger the Mimic.

Mob Abilities:
- 2 new active abilities have been added: Cloaker
  - Cloaker works similarly to Healer and Augmenter. After a brief immobile delay, the mob with Cloaker will grant 12 seconds of "Cloaked" to nearby mobs.
  - What is Cloaked? Read more about it in Custom Statuses!
- The other new ability is Wither Storm:
  - Wither Storm makes the mob blind and immobile while charging.
  - Has a delay, after which, wither skulls are rained down around players.
  - Very destructive!
  - While creating the skull rain, mob is unable to attack or move.
- A new passive ability has been added: Permacloak
  - A permacloaked mob is permanently "Cloaked". (Cloak is re-applied every 5 seconds for 5 seconds.)

Custom Statuses:
- Added a new positive status effect for enemies: "Cloaked"
  - Cloaked makes a mob invisible until the timer runs out.
  - While Cloaked, the mob emits ash particles near its location.
  - While Cloaked, the mob emits strange ghostly sounds around it. The louder they are, the more cloaked enemies there are nearby.
  - While Cloaked, if the mob takes damage, the duration of Cloaked is reduced by 3 seconds.

Changes:

Core:
- The reload message has received a rather hefty overhaul. Shoutouts to RockNRed for aesthetic ideas and assistance!
- Cartographer's reload message now links to its Github page, and to an options menu.
- Currently the only option that exists is to make the reload message less long. More to come soon!

- Helper Healing functions have been reworked to all use area effect clouds instead of Regeneration effect commands. This makes healing immediate rather than very slightly delayed.
- Helper clouds have received tweaks to ensure they are simultaneously more accurate, and don't have unintended behavior.
- Helper clouds now scale in powers of 2, rather than having a command for each value up to 8. This means any value of healing can be cast on the player by combining the right values.
- Helper clouds exist for 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 healing.

- Core has additional push functions for knockback events of varying degrees. These are very complex and hard to use outside of Cartographer (you're welcome to try) at least for now.
- Used to apply knockback to a couple new things at different amounts.

- Cartographer now uses Purple Shulker Boxes for its Shulker Box trick mechanics. This is to help prevent it from causing issues with other mechanics in maps made by other mappers.

Custom Enchantments:

- Eruption damage has been increased to 3/6/9/12/15 damage per level (was 2/4/6/8/10).
- Eruption now inflicts a small amount of knockback.
- Eruption radius reduced to 8. (was 10).

- Adrenaline, Energetic, and Frenzy have adjusted scaling.
  - The new scaling is 5 seconds for the first level, 5 seconds for the second level, and one less second per level of the enchant. (5/10/14/17/19/20 seconds)
  - The intent is to make single levels of these enchants feel more impactful and useful, though keep their power level somewhat the same.
  - Overall, scaling is adjusted to offer more buff duration uptime.

- Hunter and Duelist scale equivalently to Smite and Bane of Arthropods (2.5/5/7.5/10/12.5, instead of 2/5/7/10/12)

- Evocation has been reworked:
  - Now guarantees fangs directed from the player towards nearby mobs.
  - Each level adds one path of fangs from the player to a nearby hostile mob (within 10 blocks)
  - Level still caps at 3 (3 paths of fangs to nearby mobs).

- Regeneration now makes heart particle effects when it heals you.

- Lifesteal makes heart particle effects when it heals you.
- Lifesteal creates a sound when it triggers.

Mob Abilities:
- Helper Difficulty is now directly set based on the world's difficulty. The feature to set it to a custom value will likely return in the future.
- This is to make using Cartographer a bit more user friendly. Gone are the days of setting a random score to a number which you have no idea what it does!

- Charge now uses the player's location instead of simply moving the mob forward. This makes Charge more accurate to player position and improves interactions on some mobs.

- Laser now uses an armor stand to track. This makes the skill more accurate and removes a couple bugs involving height differences between mobs and players.

- Corpse Crawler now has variations for zombies, husks, drowned, piglins, zoglins, and bees. Each version's stats are near identical to each others.

- Duplicator now works on Piglins, Pillagers, Creepers, Spiders, and Cave Spiders.

- Breaker no longer breaks spawners.

- Healer and Augmenter now apply Slowness VII (immobilizes ground based mobs) when charging.

Bug Fixes:
- New Shulker Boxes for Custom Enchantments to separate Repeating, Auto Charge, and Infinity further. This should eliminate (or at least drastically reduce) the chance of items being replaced improperly.
- Fixed a bug where Repeating only fired the first round of bolts as Multishot, if a Crossbow also had Multishot.

Version Beta 1.1 - The Shock and Awe Update (yeah I'm gonna give updates cutesy names, cause you know, why not)

As an overview, this new version boasts:
+ Almost double the Custom Enchantments on original 1.0 launch. This includes new Trident enchants, new Bow enchants, and more!
+ Multiple new mob abilities to test your mettle against. Soulfire Novas, Fireballs, Traps, and more!
+ Custom Statuses is now an official supported module, with a current total of 6 custom status debuffs that can be applied to mobs!
+ New Enchantments that utilize the mechanics of Custom Statuses.
+ Handbooks for all modules, not just Custom Enchantments!
+ Bugs, there will probably be bugs too. But I've got the bug spray ready.


Detailed Change Log:
Additions:

Custom Statuses is an official module now, instead of a placeholder for the Stunned debuff!
- On the wiki page, its officially clarified you will need Custom Statuses to make any and all custom debuff enchants work properly.
- Added Bleed: A status effect that deals damage over time depending on the level.
  (Applying Bleed to an already Bleeding target increases the level, instead of refreshing the duration.)
- Added Shock: A status effect that deals damage over time, but in a small area around the Shocked target.
- Added Blindness support on enemies. Blindness reduces a mob's follow range by 90%.
- Added Vulnerability. Replacing "Bad Omen" on enemies, Vulnerability increases the damage enemies take from all damage instances by 1 per level.
- Added Rage. After a brief delay, this status effect aggros its victim on the nearest hostile enemy.

- Custom Statuses has an Advancement handbook page titled "Afflictions and Maladies" which details the effects of all custom statuses in game, if you find an item that utilizes them.

Custom Enchantments:
- There are now enchantments that offer compatibility with the new DoT effects in Custom Statuses.
  - Vicious / Rend: Give your melee attacks / arrows the ability to inflict Bleed.
  (Vicious has up to 3 levels, increasing the base duration of Bleed. Rend is single level, with a flat 5 second duration.)
  - Overload / Conductive: Give your melee attacks / arrows the ability to inflict Shocked.
  (Overload has up to 3 levels, increasing duration of Shocked. Conductive is single level, with a flat 5 second duration.)

- Additionally, there are enchantments that offer compatibility with Vulnerability.
  - Committed / Pin Down: Give your melee attacks / arrows Vulnerability.
  (Committed has up to 3 levels, increasing the potency of Vulnerability. Pin Down is a single level, 5 second duration, at Vulnerability II.)

- But that's not all. There are a couple of new melee specific Enchantments:
  - Echo: Striking an enemy has a chance to increase your attack speed briefly by 100%.
    (+20% chance per level to gain 1 second of faster attack speed).
  - Evocation: Killing an enemy has the chance to evoke the wrath of mysterious forces, which claw up from the ground and damage nearby foes.
    (25% increased chance per level, with a maximum of a 75% chance.)
  - Surging Strike: Strike further away from you with a sprint attack, dealing AoE damage in a line past your initial target.
    (+2 damage per level. Surging attacks strike foes that are up to 7 blocks away from the player.)

- There are new general passive Enchantments:
  - Energetic: When killing an enemy, grants Haste for 2 seconds per held/worn level. (Max of 12 seconds)
  - Soulbound: When dropped on death (and not destroyed), this item is immediately returned to your inventory when you respawn.
  - Spurs: When held or worn, walking into a cobweb instantly destroys it (Credit to GavstarB for this idea).

- And a new tool Enchantment:
  - Splintering: This Axe Enchantment causes barrels, doors, and trapdoors you break to stun nearby enemies!

- Bow and Crossbow Enchantments have gotten some new additions, inspired by CTM Community suggestions and Minecraft Dungeons!
  - Frost: Gives your arrows slowing properties.
  - Tempo Theft: Gives your arrows speed stealing properties.
  (Gain Speed when shooting a mob. Gain an increasingly more potent Haste effect at higher levels.)
  - Trueshot: Gives your arrows no gravity.
  - Volatile: Straps fireworks to your arrows to do AoE damage.

- As one final Crossbow addition, Flame now works on Crossbows. Flame on!

- Finally, Tridents have gotten their long needed lineup of Enchantments, besides "just Current".
  - Hydraulic: Trade the long range capabilities of a trident for a close ranged AoE shove attack.
  - Ricochet: Causes a stream of water to bounce from enemy to enemy.
  (Increasing bounce count per level.)
  - Tempest: Increases the damage of ranged throws per level.
  (+3 damage per level.)


Mob Abilities:
- An army of new active attacks join the front lines:
  - Fireball: After a brief channel, the mob creates and directs a fireball projectile towards the nearest player!
  - Soulfire Nova: After a channel, the mob drains the health of all nearby players, healing itself!
  - Trapper: After a brief channel, the mob throws out multiple snaring projectiles behind the player, which slow and hurt those who walk on them!

- There are multiple new death triggering abilities:
  - Spectral: Similar to Exalted foes, killing a Spectral enemy summons a shadowy guardian to take revenge!
    - Spectres are lower (well, than Exalted at least) health assassin type mobs that spawn in with the "Ambush" ability.
  - There are 4 new "Blood" effects. When an enemy with a Blood effect is killed, it applies a buff to nearby enemies!
    - Brutal Blood: Slightly heal nearby foes, and improve their damage.
    (Each slain Brutal foe applies +1 melee damage to nearby foes, up to +5 max)
    - Relentless Blood: Slightly heal nearby foes, and improve their move speed.
    (Each slain Relentless foe applies +10% speed to nearby foes, up to 50% max)
    - Devious Blood: Slightly heal nearby foes, and reset their cooldowns.
    (Enemies without cooldowns receive 10 seconds of Speed I instead)
    - Sacrificial Blood: Slightly heal nearby foes, and give them an Absorption shield.
    (Slain Sacrificial foes grant Absorption I for 60 seconds to nearby foes)
  (All Blood effects heal affected mobs by 4 health)

- Mob Abilities now has an Advancement handbook page titled "Enemy Observations".
- Enemy Observations fills out as you kill mobs with special abilities, detailing special abilities in the handbook page.


Changes:

Custom Enchantments:

- Current now gives a second of hidden Haste 10 when the trident returns to you.
  (This will make the attack cooldown faster when your trident returns, making it easier to hit the mob dragged to you.)

- Sharpshot and Point Blank have received scaling adjustments, as they were considerably outperforming Power.
  - Sharpshot now scales 50%/100%/150% increased damage per second of travel. (Was 100/200/300)
  - Point Blank now scales 70%/140%/210% at close range, reducing as the arrow travels for its first half second. (Was 120/240/360)
  - Point Blank's reduction has been scaled down by 50% (This means that outside of Point Blank's effective range, arrows remain unaffected, just like before).
  - Point Blank's reduction now reduces an arrow's damage up to 10%/20%/30% of Point Blank's effectiveness. (Was 0%/0%/0%).

  - To clarify, Sharpshot and Point Blank increase damage additively, in relation to a Bow's base damage.
  This means that the percentage is unaffected by Power. Power, Sharpshot, and Point Blank, do not affect each other.
  They can be stacked, but they do not increase each other's damage.

- Second Wind has been reworked (again, I swear one day I will get this enchant just right):
  Developer Note: This description of Second Wind is verbose and detailed. The enchantment's new description and a TLDR can be found beneath this list.
  - When you would take a lethal hit [from a mob], force Evasion to trigger.
  - Gain 8 Health in "Volatile Shielding" that lasts for 8 seconds.
  - If you kill a mob, immediately heal for the total remaining shield health. (The shield health will vanish).
  - If the shield health expires (runs out of time or is used up by attacks) it detonates, dealing damage to you and nearby mobs.
  
  - The more times this effect triggers in repeated instances, the less time Volatile Shielding lasts for. (Down to 2 seconds).
  - The more times this effect triggers in repeated instances, the more damage the detonation will do. (Up to 18 damage).

  - New Description:
  "With Evasion, If you would take a fatal hit from a mob, Evasion automatically triggers.
  You are then granted a "Volatile Shield" of 8 health for 8 seconds.
  If you lose that shielding, it detonates, hurting you.
  If you kill a mob, the shielding is defused, and you heal equal to the shielding's total.
  Repeated triggers of Second Wind in succession make the shielding less effective, and more dangerous."

  - TLDR: While the core idea of Second Wind (prolong your life by blocking lethal attack, in exchange for needing to kill mobs to avoid a penalty)
  is the same, the enchant has been streamlined and simplified to make it more responsive and effective.
  A penalty for repeated triggers has been added to prevent the enchantment from making a player immortal.

- Two Handed has been reworked:
  - No longer debuffs the player if an item is held in the offhand and mainhand.
  - Now affects entire hotbar (the curse effect will trigger so long as the Two Handed item is in the hotbar)
  - Two Handed now places an offhand item (while the Two Handed item is in the hotbar) in an "Item Knapsack".
    - The Item Knapsack remains in the offhand. (but can be moved)
    - When right clicked on the ground, the Item Knapsack is opened, placing the item it contains.
    - Items placed by knapsacks Glow, are Indestructible, and don't Despawn (until they are picked up)
    - While inside an Item Knapsack, an item has no effect on the player's stats. (Its enchants will not activate and its attributes will not change the player).
  
  - New Description:
  "When in the hotbar, this item packages and stores up any item placed in your offhand (rendering it ineffective)." 
  
  - TLDR: Two Handed no longer debuffs the player, and instead locks away any item placed in the offhand, preventing it from affecting your stats.

- Curse of Shattering now works on Netherite Items (Tools, Weapons, and Armor).

- The Handbook for Custom Enchantments has been renamed to "Arcane Notes". There have been minor formatting adjustments to the Arcane Notes handbook page.

Mob Abilities:
- Exalted now have properly set attributes. Their "new" stats are:
  - 60 Health
  - 0.26 Movement Speed (Slightly faster than a normal Zombie)
  - 1 Knockback Resistance
  - 12 Attack Damage
  - 40 Follow Range (Same as a normal Zombie)
  - (Exalted still have the "charge" ability).
- Exalted spawn Slowness and Weakness duration reduced to 3 seconds (was 5).
- Nova attack particles have been reworked. Each nova's attack particle will now display a ring of particles around the mob equivalent to the nova's attack range.
- Active Ability animations are now cancelled when a player walks out of range, instead of paused.
- Laser is now far more destructive and dangerous. Make sure to block that line of sight!

- Token Manager Changes:
  - The token manager will not grant a mob a token if they cannot currently see a player. (Active Ability animations will not start if the mob cannot see the player)
    - A mob *can* take a token from a player it is not attacking. But it cannot take a token from a player it could not physically see. (Due to a wall or obstruction)
    - Mobs can take tokens from players they are not directly looking at. (This has always been the case, just to help clarify things.)
    - This does not mean you are immune from attacks through walls. Novas for example will still deal damage to players within radius even if there are blocks obstructing them. (This will likely eventually change).
    - Helper Difficulty (score "helper_diff") now supports up to 5, in case you wanted to involve more panic.

Custom Statuses:
- Mob Abilities' Active Ability animations are now interrupted by the Stunned debuff.

Bug Fixes:
- Fixed Stunned enemies reducing the duration of stun on other stunned enemies.
- Fixed Regeneration not working.
- Fixed Eruption not working.
- Fixed Current not removing drag tag on reeled in enemies. (Current will no longer push mobs away from you.)
- The Shulker Box relied upon to do item manipulation has been moved to 4206900 0 4206900. The chunk containing those coordinates is now constantly loaded.
  (Cartographer Core hopes everyone appreciates this nice meme.)
- Exalted now have properly set attributes. They will be much harder to kill. >:D
- Reflect Shields now properly slow, harden, and sturdify enemies (their attributes now work).

- Credits have been updated and modified to be more specific and accurate.

Hotfix: Version Beta 1.0.1
Bugs Fixed:
- World automatically places Shulker Box at 0 0 0 and sets world spawn there.
(Fixing all enchantments that rely on it, such as Auto Charge, Repeating, and Infinity.)
- Fixed token system for mob abilities not applying statistics to players.
(Active abilities should now work.)
- Fixed Custom Enchantmemts not creating "helper_arrow_dmg" scoreboard on reload.
(Sharpshot and Point Blank work again).

Thanks to Matt_97 and Gizmo for finding these bugs!
