Version Beta 1.1

Additions:

Custom Statuses:
- Added Bleed: A status effect that deals damage over time depending on the level.
  (Applying Bleed to an already Bleeding target increases the level, instead of refreshing the duration.)
- Added Shock: A status effect that deals damage over time, but in a small area around the Shocked target.
- Added Blindness support on enemies. Blindness reduces a mob's follow range by 90%.
- Added Vulnerability. Replacing "Bad Omen" on enemies, Vulnerability increases the damage enemies take from all damage instances by 1 per level.
- Added Rage. After a brief delay, this status effect aggros its victim on the nearest hostile enemy.

Custom Enchantments:
- There are now enchantments that offer compatibility with the new DoT effects in Custom Statuses.
  - Vicious / Rend: Give your melee attacks / arrows the ability to inflict Bleed.
  (Vicious has up to 3 levels, increasing the base duration of Bleed. Rend is single level, with a flat 5 second duration.)
  - Shocking / Conductive: Give your melee attacks / arrows the ability to inflict Shocked.
  (Shocking has up to 3 levels, increasing duration of Shocked. Conductive is single level, with a flat 5 second duration.)

- Additionally, there are enchantments that offer compatibility with Vulnerability.
  - Committed / Pin Down: Give your melee attacks / arrows Vulnerability.
  (Committed has up to 3 levels, increasing the potency of Vulnerability. Pin Down is a single level, 5 second duration, at Vulnerability II.)

- But that's not all. There are a couple of new melee specific Enchantments:
  - Echo: Striking an enemy has a chance to increase your attack speed briefly by 100%.
    (+20% chance per level to gain 1 second of faster attack speed).
  - Evocation: Killing an enemy has the chance to evoke the wrath of mysterious forces, which claw up from the ground and damage nearby foes.
    (25% increased chance per level, with a maximum of a 75% chance.)
  - Surging Strike: Strike further away from you with a sprint attack, dealing AoE damage in a line past your initial target.
    (+2 damage per level. Surging attacks strike foes that are up to 7 blocks away from the player.)

- There are new general passive Enchantments:
  - Energetic: When killing an enemy, grants Haste for 2 seconds per held/worn level. (Max of 12 seconds)
  - Soulbound: When dropped on death (and not destroyed), this item is immediately returned to your inventory when you respawn.
  - Spurs: When held or worn, walking into a cobweb instantly destroys it (Credit to GavstarB for this idea).

- And a new tool Enchantment:
  - Splintering: This Axe Enchantment causes barrels, doors, and trapdoors you break to stun nearby enemies!

- Bow and Crossbow Enchantments have gotten some new additions, inspired by CTM Community suggestions and Minecraft Dungeons!
  - Frost: Gives your arrows slowing properties.
  - Tempo Theft: Gives your arrows speed stealing properties.
  (Gain Speed when shooting a mob. Gain an increasingly more potent Haste effect at higher levels.)
  - Trueshot: Gives your arrows no gravity.
  - Volatile: Straps fireworks to your arrows to do AoE damage.

- As one final Crossbow addition, Flame now works on Crossbows. Flame on!

- Finally, Tridents have gotten their long needed lineup of Enchantments, besides "just Current".
  - Hydraulic: Trade the long range capabilities of a trident for a close ranged AoE shove attack.
  - Ricochet: Causes a stream of water to bounce from enemy to enemy.
  (Increasing bounce count per level.)
  - Tempest: Increases the damage of ranged throws per level.
  (+3 damage per level.)

Mob Abilities:
- An army of new active attacks join the front lines:
  - Fireball: After a brief channel, the mob creates and directs a fireball projectile towards the nearest player!
  - Soulfire Nova: After a channel, the mob drains the health of all nearby players, healing itself!
  - Trapper: After a brief channel, the mob throws out multiple snaring projectiles behind the player, which slow and hurt those who walk on them!

- There are multiple new death triggering abilities:
  - Spectral: Similar to Exalted foes, killing a Spectral enemy summons a shadowy guardian to take revenge!
    - Spectres are lower (well, than Exalted at least) health assassin type mobs that spawn in with the "Ambush" ability.
  - There are 4 new "Blood" effects. When an enemy with a Blood effect is killed, it applies a buff to nearby enemies!
    - Brutal Blood: Slightly heal nearby foes, and improve their damage.
    (Each slain Brutal foe applies +1 melee damage to nearby foes, up to +5 max)
    - Relentless Blood: Slightly heal nearby foes, and improve their move speed.
    (Each slain Relentless foe applies +10% speed to nearby foes, up to 50% max)
    - Devious Blood: Slightly heal nearby foes, and reset their cooldowns.
    (Enemies without cooldowns receive 10 seconds of Speed I instead)
    - Sacrificial Blood: Slightly heal nearby foes, and give them an Absorption shield.
    (Slain Sacrificial foes grant Absorption I for 60 seconds to nearby foes)
  (All Blood effects heal affected mobs by 4 health)

Changes:

Custom Enchantments:

- Current now gives a second of hidden Haste 10 when the trident returns to you.
  (This will make the attack cooldown faster when your trident returns, making it easier to hit the mob dragged to you.)

- Second Wind has been reworked (again, I swear one day I will get this enchant just right):
  Developer Note: This description of Second Wind is verbose and detailed. The enchantment's new description and a TLDR can be found beneath this list.
  - When you would take a lethal hit, force Evasion to trigger.
  - Gain 8 Health in "Volatile Shielding" that lasts for 8 seconds.
  - If you kill a mob, immediately heal for the total remaining shield health. (The shield health will vanish).
  - If the shield health expires (runs out of time or is used up by attacks) it detonates, dealing damage to you and nearby mobs.
  
  - The more times this effect triggers in repeated instances, the less time Volatile Shielding lasts for. (Down to 2 seconds).
  - The more times this effect triggers in repeated instances, the more damage the detonation will do. (Up to 18 damage).

  - New Description:
  With Evasion, If you would take a fatal hit, Evasion automatically triggers.
  You are then granted a "Volatile Shield" of 8 health for 8 seconds.
  If you lose that shielding, it detonates, hurting you.
  If you kill a mob, the shielding is defused, and you heal equal to the shielding's total.
  Repeated triggers of Second Wind make the shielding less effective, and more dangerous.

  - TLDR: While the core idea of Second Wind (prolong your life by blocking lethal attack, in exchange for needing to kill mobs to avoid a penalty)
  is the same, the enchant has been streamlined and simplified to make it more responsive and effective.
  A penalty for repeated triggers has been added to prevent the enchantment from making a player immortal.

- Two Handed has been reworked:
  - No longer debuffs the player if an item is held in the offhand and mainhand.
  - Now affects entire hotbar (the curse effect will trigger so long as the Two Handed item is in the hotbar)
  - Two Handed now places an offhand item (while the Two Handed item is in the hotbar) in an "Item Knapsack".
    - The Item Knapsack remains in the offhand. (but can be moved)
    - When right clicked on the ground, the Item Knapsack is opened, placing the item it contains.
    - Items placed by knapsacks Glow, are Indestructible, and don't Despawn (until they are picked up)
    - While inside an Item Knapsack, an item has no effect on the player's stats. (Its enchants will not activate and its attributes will not change the player).
  
  - New Description:
  "When worn or in the hotbar, this item packages and stores up any item placed in your offhand (rendering it ineffective)." 
  
  - TLDR: Two Handed no longer debuffs the player, and instead locks away any item placed in the offhand, preventing it from affecting your stats.

- Curse of Shattering now works on Netherite Items (Tools, Weapons, and Armor).

Mob Abilities:
- Exalted now have properly set attributes. Their "new" stats are:
  - 60 Health
  - 0.26 Movement Speed (Slightly faster than a normal Zombie)
  - 1 Knockback Resistance
  - 12 Attack Damage
  - 40 Follow Range (Same as a normal Zombie)
  - (Exalted still have the "charge" ability).
- Exalted spawn Slowness and Weakness duration reduced to 3 seconds (was 5).
- 

Bug Fixes:
- Fixed Stunned enemies reducing the duration of stun on other stunned enemies.
- Fixed Regeneration not working.
- Fixed Eruption not working.
- Fixed Current not removing drag tag on reeled in enemies. (Current will no longer push mobs away from you.)
- The Shulker Box relied upon to do item manipulation has been moved to 4206900 0 4206900. The chunk containing those coordinates is now constantly loaded.
  (Cartographer Core hopes everyone appreciates this nice meme.)
- Exalted now have properly set attributes. They will be much harder to kill. >:D

Hotfix: Version Beta 1.0.1
Bugs Fixed:
- World automatically places Shulker Box at 0 0 0 and sets world spawn there.
(Fixing all enchantments that rely on it, such as Auto Charge, Repeating, and Infinity.)
- Fixed token system for mob abilities not applying statistics to players.
(Active abilities should now work.)
- Fixed Custom Enchantmemts not creating "helper_arrow_dmg" scoreboard on reload.
(Sharpshot and Point Blank work again).

Thanks to Matt_97 and Gizmo for finding these bugs!
