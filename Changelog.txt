THE BIG TODO LIST:
- Make Shattering only take 50% of an item's remaining durability.
- Toggles for Global options of personal stuff. (Aka defaults)
- Toggle for Placed Lexica behavior. (either open menu or give you a Lexica)
- Deadeye only targets enemies in front of you.

Cartographer, Patch TBD - Wrath of the Podiatrist, Part 1

This is the first in a set of optimization and clean up patches. The goal of these series of patches is to re-optimize many sections of the pack
(creating a more fluid and fresh experience, with less lag) address a couple balance issues, and patch some holes in each module.

Overall, this still means a couple new features, but also a *ton* of reworks. Reworks, reworks, and more reworks. Many things are getting reworked!

Despite reworks, the goal is to expand on what the pack offers while also minimizing the content it offers that is similar to something offered by Vanilla
or elsewhere in Cartographer.

And with that, let's get on with the updates!

Additions:

Core:
 - A new feature has been added to Core: The Lexica Cartographia
    - The Lexica is an in game holdable manual item. It serves as the new home for full and verbose descriptions of Cartographer effects.
    - There is a placeable variant via a structure block structure.
    - Lexica entries only show up if you've discovered them (like Advancements)
    - Advancement and Tellraw entries have been shortened and simplified drastically.
      - Overall, they should still provide a basic understanding of the enchantment, but have less complex details and simplify understanding.

 - All entity hit detection in the entire pack has been moved to Gibbsly's Entity Hit Detection and ID system.
 - A slightly modified version of Gibbsly's system is now included as a separate "Core" datapack. This must now be installed in order for Cartographer to work.
    - This is labeled as "Cartographer - Core - Entity Hit Detection". Install this datapack with everything else in Cartographer.
      - Functionality wise, this is identical to Gibbsly's EHID system. If you are already using it for some other system, you do not need to install this datapack.
      - TLDR - If you have no idea what I am talking about and are not using Gibbsly's Custom Shields, install this datapack. :)

Custom Enchantments:
 - Thorns 2.0 is a custom enchantment in Cartographer which serves as an improvement to the vanilla Thorns enchant. [Custom Tag: {Thorns:1}]
    - Description: When attacked, deal damage back to the enemy equal to the level of Thorns you have.
    - Additionally, on hit melee enchants on items with Thorns will also apply their effects (like Fire Aspect)
    - Only if an item has both an on hit enchantment and Thorns will this apply (so Fire Aspect and Thorns on the same item)
    - No additional armor durability loss, or annoying chance based effects!

 - Loyalty 2.0 is a custom enchantment in Cartographer which serves as an improvement to the vanilla Loyalty enchantment. [Custom Tag: {Loyalty:1}]
    - Description: When thrown, this trident creates a "Prismarine Conch" in the slot it was occupying. When
    it lands, the trident will travel back to and return to your inventory, replacing the Conch when it reaches you.
    - Just like the vanilla version, higher levels of Loyalty increase the travel time.
    - Just like the vanilla version, hitting an enemy with the Loyalty trident makes it return faster.
    - Loyalty 2.0 times have been designed so that the approximate time to return is the same as vanilla Loyalty.
    - Loyalty 2.0 has a max level of 10.

 - Power and Punch have been brought to Crossbows with Custom Enchantments, with maximum levels of 10 and 5, respectively.
    - Simply apply the vanilla enchants to crossbows. No custom tags needed.

 - A couple new bow enchantments:
    - Putrefy: Inflicts the new Infection debuff in Custom Statuses (see below) for 5 seconds. [Custom Tag: {Putrefy:1}]
    - Flash: Inflicts Stunned on the hit target. [Custom Tag: {Flash:1}]
      - Stun duration and chance to stun are dependent on how charged the arrow shot is.
      - Maxes at 1 second and 70% chance, respectively.
 
 - And a new curse enchantment (this has been in the code for a while but not fully implemented or finished):
    - Curse of Regret: Using the item inflicts 2 damage per level of Curse of Regret. (Maximum level is 5) [Custom Tag: {CurseRegret:1}]
      - Damage is negated by all sources of damage resistance.
 
Custom Statuses:
 - New Effect: Infection
    - Deals 2 damage per second to the afflicted mob.
    - Afflicted mob is affected by a percent loss of movement speed and melee damage based on how close to death they are.
      - The closer to death, the more debilitating the effect.
    - When an Infected mob dies, it spreads the effect (with it's remaining duration) to 2 nearby targets (not Infected, within 6 blocks).
    - If it cannot spread the effect, it deals 6 damage in a small AoE instead.
      - AoE is half the radius of the spread distance. (3 Blocks)

 - All Status effects can be inflicted now via vanilla potions with custom Nausea effects.
    - Nausea 10 = Stunning
    - Nausea 11 = Shocked
    - Nausea 12 = Infection
    - Nausea 13 = Bleeding (only level 1, duration max = 10 seconds)
    - Nausea 14 = Cloaked (for use on enemy potion drops wink)

Changes:

- Core now overwrites every vanilla mob loot table in the game for death detection systems.
  - You will nowhave to extend this to custom loot tables if you want death effects (abilities and Infection) to work on enemies.
  - You will now have to modify *these* loot tables if you want to edit the vanilla mob drops in the map.
  - More details can be found on the wiki's Core page.
  - It overall is a bit more of a hassle, but this will save on some performance, and allow enemies with death effects to drop their items.

Custom Enchantments:

 - Spectral Arrows now work with all Cartographer Bow and Crossbow enchantments.

 - The following enchantments now apply to Trident projectiles as if they were melee attacks.
    - Duelist
    - Hunter
    - Fire Aspect
    - Frostbite
    - Committed
    - Stunning
    - Vicious
    - Overload
    - Decay

  Developer Commentary: In order to make Duelist and Hunter more consistent with Smite and Bane of Arthropods, they now deal their increased damage on ranged attacks.
  To extend the general usefulness and item space for trident design, the above melee on hit effects will also work on ranged attacks.

 - Adrenaline, Energetic, and Frenzy have all received a scaling tweak.
    - Each level increases your move speed, mining speed, or attack damage by 20% per level.
    - The effect duration lasts 10 seconds, and each second the effect decreases in potency by 2% (per level).
    - TLDR: Higher levels of the enchants give a bigger potency, but in a burst that decays at a higher rate.
    - Time buffed is constant at all levels.
    - Revamped sfx and vfx for all 3 enchantments.

  Developer Commentary: While v2 of the scaling was better than v1, it left a lot to be desired where now higher levels of the enchant felt progressively less useful.
  v3 of the scaling attempts to solve this problem, by allowing a potency increase (shudder) but capping the duration at 10 seconds, and increasing how fast the buff
  drains over time. Hopefully, this will be the last scaling rework.

 - Auto Charge and Repeating:
    - Auto Charge will now trigger on Repeating Crossbows, reloading 1 Ammo per activation.
    - Repeating will now work with Spectral and Tipped Arrows.
      - Tipped Arrows *always* have priority on additional shot. Spectral comes next, then normals.
      - First arrow follows conventional vanilla priority (arrow in "lowest" inventory slot)
      - Auto Charge reload will load a copy of the current "next shot" (so if your next shot will be a Poison Arrow, Auto Charge will copy the Poison Arrow instead)
      - All new effects work with Multishot

 - Committed:
    - Duration increased to 4 seconds (from 3) to be consistent with other effects that inflict constant time potency debuffs. (Frostbite)

 - Curse of Shattering:
    - Now takes 50% of the item's remaining durability, rather than reducing it to 1 durability.

  Developer Commentary: Removing from remaining durability serves as a less punishing effect that doesn't necessarily force a player into immediate downtime, but will still punish
  a player more for dying while holding the item.

 - Decay:
    - Now uses the Custom Status "Infection" instead of Wither.
    - Inflicts 3/5/7 seconds of Infection, based on level.

  Developer: The introduction of Infection is to move Decay away from Wither. Wither in the past acted like a "different flavor" of Fire Aspect. In an effort to
  make the enchant more useful and unique, it has been given an entirely custom effect.

 - Deadeye:
    - Now inflicts on hit ranged enchantments (currently not including Punch).
    - Improved vfx and sfx.

 - Eruption:
    - Knockback is now counted as an "on hit melee" enchantment.

  Developer Commentary: With the introduction of Thorns 2.0 and counting Knockback as one of its effects, it made sense to retroactively also include it on Eruption.

 - Evocation:
    - Reworked!
      - Evocation: "Special Attacks" (Sprint, Crits, and Sneak Attacks) with this weapon create Evoker Fangs.
      - Fangs are created at the cost of -70/-50/-30% Attack Speed for your next hit.
      - On hit effects (such as Fire Aspect) are applied to the fangs.
        - As an extra mention, this does work with Knockback. Fangs will apply vertical momentum instead of horizontal momentum.
      - Pattern of the fangs is dependent on the special attack used.
      - Cannot be used below 50% attack timer.
      - Fangs from Evocation are killed if the player walks over them.

  Developer Commentary: Evocation sat in a position where it wasn't too useful in a fight, and could still hurt the user. Since the effect only triggered on a mob's death,
  the effect only saved you time in cleaning up an already finished fight. This new rework offers it as a powerful "super attack" on the weapon, at the cost of some recharge
  speed. It has also received the on hit synergy treatment, to open up more potential combos.

 - Evasion:
    - Individual dodge chance per level decreased to 4% (from 5%).
    - Increased level cap to 20 (from 10). [Now a total of 80% attainable dodge chance]
    - Pity math slightly nerfed to compensate higher stackability. (Maxes at 20% additional chance instead of 30% additional chance.)

  Developer Commentary: Evasion is an interesting enchant that in its previous scaling, was poised to be a "core" defense enchantment, but didn't scale the same as Protection.
  The above changes are to modify the scaling so that it has effectively the exact same scaling as Protection. While still offering its own other upsides, this will help Evasion
  and Protection levels feel more "equal" in worth. (And mathematically, a full 20 levels of Evasion will equal a full 20 levels of protection, either negating 80% of attacks,
  or 80% of the damage from attacks)

 - Hydraulic:
    - Tempest now increases the damage of Hydraulic shoves.

 - Ricochet:
    - No longer creates a projectile, instantly targets nearby entities instead.
    - Tempest now increases the damage of Ricochet bounces.

 - Sapper:
    - If a Sapper pickaxe has Adrenaline, Frenzy, or Energetic, those enchantments will activate when you break a spawner.
      - Like Thorns 2.0, the pickaxe must have the enchantment.

  Developer Commentary: With synergies being added across the board, they are also being added to Sapper to allow more diverse item creation.

 - Satiation:
    - Reworked: Now provides 15 seconds of Absorption (with potency equal to your level) whenever you eat food (or drink a potion).
    - Additionally, provides 5 seconds of Resistance 1 when you eat food.
    - New level cap is 3 (from 6).
    - Not a feature, but worth noting this can be applied to and works on the actual food item itself.

  Developer Commentary: Satiation prior to this acted as a "different flavor of Lifesteal" that was potentially more powerful, but more frustrating to use than Lifesteal.
  In an effort to make effects more unique, the enchant has been turned into a new effect which allows one to use consumables more readily in combat. It can also be applied
  to the food items themselves, allowing you to create food that provides Absorption/Resistance.

 - Surging Strike:
    - Now deals 50/66/75% of the attack's base damage rather than 2/4/6 flat damage. (Equivalent to Sweeping Edge)
    - Now triggers on mobs up to 4 blocks away without the sprint attack. Sprint attack still allows hitting mobs up to 7 blocks away.
    - Knockback reduced by 50%.
    - On hit effect enchantments apply to enemies hit by the thrust attack.

  Developer Commentary: Scaling adjusted to work with Sweeping Edge so these two parallel effects are consistent. Additionally, it has been given an additional "grace"
  trigger, and can be activated without sprint hits (but the maximum value is still with sprint hits). As compensation for the easier to use trigger and potential higher damage
  on larger scaling weapons, its knockback has been reduced.

 - Splintering:
    - Now deals 3 damage to all hit mobs.
    - Stun duration reduced to 2 seconds (from 3).

  Developer Commentary: Damage has been added to Splintering to make it feel more impactful in use. Stun duration has been reduced in an effort to reduce the amount of potent hard
  CC effects players can use on mobs.

 - Soulbound:
    - Now protects the item when you die from anything that would destroy it.

 - Tempo Theft:
    - No longer provies Haste at any level.
    - Reworked effect: Steal 10% Movement Speed from an attacked mob for 10 seconds per level.
      - Steal applies a slowing effect to the mob equivalent to the speed you temporarily gain.

  Developer Commentary: This was always intended to be the ideal version of Tempo Theft (i.e. the exact effect from Minecraft Dungeons) but 1.15.2 did not have the attribute command.
  The effect has been reworked to use the attribute command, adding the speed stealing bonus. The haste has been removed and the speed tuned to compensate for an on demand potent
  slowing ranged attack.

 - Two Handed:
    - Item is now a "Compressed Item" not in a Knapsack. Can no longer be placed.
    - Compressed Items in your inventory or offhand when not holding a Two Handed item are automatically uncompressed.
    - An item takes 1 second to uncompress after you stop holding a Two Handed item.

  Developer Commentary: Two Handed no longer has Knapsack functionality as it was the source of many unfixable duplication bugs. As compensation, Compressed Items
  are even smoother, and auto uncompress in your inventory. Your offhand item takes a bit longer to uncompress in order to increase the impact of the Two Handed enchant
  mid combat, ensuring the effects are felt more in general, and not rarely when you use the item.

 - Volatile:
    - Level cap reduced to 1 (from 3).
    - Firework now deals damage equivalent to the damage the arrow deals. (Approximately)
    - Volatile explosions now also inflict on hit ranged enchantments (like Flame) to enemies caught within the blast.
      - As an extra mention, this *does* work with Punch.
    - Volatile arrows should create explosions even if they kill their targets.
    - Volatile arrows no longer create explosions when they hit blocks.

  Developer Commentary: Volatile has lost level scaling in exchange for scaling with the direct power of the arrow. Additionally, it now serves as the Bow/Crossbow's
  propogation effect, allowing splash debuffs of custom enchantment effects. Explosions have been removed from block hits to make the enchant consistent with other
  Bow effects, and because it was causing performance issues.

Custom Statuses:

 - Shocked:
    - Chance of knock back when damage tick received reduced to 20% (from 100%)
    - Chance of "mini stun" when damage tick received increased to 20% (from 0%)
    - (Mini stun and knock back are mutually exclusive events. Only one can activate per tick)
    - RNG pity system implemented to make chance more consistent.

  Developer Commentary: Proper uses of past Shocked could easily prevent hordes of enemies from ever getting close to the player. In an effort to reduce this effect,
  the chance of Knockback has been reduced severely. As a side grade, Shocked can now mini stun the crowd, which will slow them down briefly, but also cancel any
  active attacks or abilities. As with Evasion, a pity system has been built in to help ensure you get at least one activation out of the CC.

 - Vulnerability:
    - Is now called "Exposed" since the mechanic works and functions differently from Resistance (and thus should follow a more unique naming scheme)


Cartographer, Patch 2021.2.0 - Divine Additions

Alright lets start out with the announcements!

First, I am no longer considering Cartographer in open beta! Any beta versions of Cartographer will be marked accordingly on github.

There's a slight change to my naming format which might be a tad confusing, but the overall patch is going to go "Year.Month.Hotfix". So welcome to 2020.11.0!
Individual modules will be named with version counts (V1.0 / V1.1 etc). This is to hopefully avoid confusion with modules of "version 1.0" but a patch of a later date.

Cartographer is also updating to 1.16.5 and higher. Piglin Brutes have been added to all hostile tags necessary.
This means the datapack will no longer work in versions before 1.16.2. Sorry anyone who was using those versions!

We're moving up due to complications with security in 1.16.1. Additionally, the upcoming project I'm leading (more below) is going to be a 1.16.5 release!

Now onto the update itself.

This is an update to prepare Cartographer for use in an upcoming project I've been proud to help lead: Divinity's End.
As the first major map to use Cartographer, this is super exciting! A lot of these changes are being made with the balance
of that project in mind, but also to improve features across the board.

This doesn't mean no new content though. There are additions to Mob Abilities, Custom Statuses, and 2 new modules. (Repair Stations and Mimics)
And now lets get into the details!

Additions:

Repair Stations bring an alternative to anvils, for maps that do not want to include anvils, but still have repairable gear.
- Repair Stations can be summoned into the world with a structure block. See the wiki for more details.
- Repair Stations can only repair items with durability, and items that aren't fully repaired.
- Repair Stations will cost the user Experience Levels, Lapis Lazuli, and the material the item is made with.
- When you repair an item, its experience and lapis cost will double. (Material cost is constant)
- Items cannot be repaired over a cap. This cap is by default set to 50 Levels and 20 Lapis. If either is above the allowed threshold, the item is irreparable.
- Default starter repair cost of items with no stats is 12 Levels, 4 Lapis. This will probably change based on user feedback.

Mimics bring the stereotypical greedy player punisher to Minecraft. Warning, these Mimics aren't fooling around.
- Mimics appear as trapped chests, and are placeable via structure blocks.
- If a Mimic is opened, it will reveal itself, damaging the player for their foolishness, and stealing some of their hunger bar.
- Mimics can be broken in dormant state, or shot with an arrow. Doing so will reveal them, and do some free damage to them.
- When Mimics are threatened, they get angry. You won't like them when they're angry.
- You might be able to loot a Mimic if you're invisible, or if you have some disguise (while it is in the dormant state).
- Mapmakers can customize what loot mimics drop on death. Simply place the items in the chest in creative mode, or while the mimic is inactive.
- Mimics scale their stats based on the armor value of the player opening them. The stronger the player, the stronger the Mimic.

Core:
- Core now features a very heftily overhauled reload message.
  - Message now features buttons to configure various Cartographer options, see a list of credits, and access the wiki and download pages.
  - Every module in Cartographer with handbook advancements now features chat prompts which help draw attention to custom effects.
  - Both the reload message can be turned off (into a more minimal version) and so can handbook chat prompts.
  - Core now features player array data storage and manipulation, used across the board for enchants that affect the player's inventory.

- Core now features a robust multiplayer array player modification system, courtesy of Suso!
  This has been integrated into many player modifying effects to hopefully make them smoother.

Custom Enchantments:
- 2 (technically 3) New Enchantments to brawl with!
  - Executioner: When a mob is attacked by this *melee* weapon, if the attack would leave them below 10% of their health, they are immediately killed instead.
    - Additional Levels increase this threshold by 7.5%.
    - Max of 3 levels. (total of 25% threshold)
  - Vanquisher: Elite enemies attacked by this *melee* weapon take 2.5 more damage per level.
    - Max of 5 levels. (+12.5 damage)
    - any "elite" enemy is a hostile mob with the tag "elite"
  - Deadeye: This crossbow fires instant traveling bolts that auto lock on nearby enemies instead of arrows, doing 10 damage.
    - Single Level
    - This enchant has technically existed and worked for a while, but now it is "properly" introduced, and will have entries in Cartographer.

- New Option: Toggle Charge Info 
  - Changes the position of enchantment charge/ammo count information (for Echo and Repeating, see below).
  - Can be set to the actionbar, subtitle, or entirely invisible.
  - Set on a per player basis.

Mob Abilities:
- 3 new active abilities have been added: Cloaker
  - Cloaker works similarly to Healer and Augmenter. After a brief immobile delay, the mob with Cloaker will grant 12 seconds of "Cloaked" to nearby mobs.
  - What is Cloaked? Read more about it in Custom Statuses!
- Next up: Wind Nova
  - Very similar to existing nova attacks, but when hit, you are launched into the air instead!
  - No guaranteed fall protection. Better grab some feather falling!
- The other new ability is Wither Storm:
  - Wither Storm makes the mob blind and immobile while charging.
  - Has a delay, after which, wither skulls are rained down around players.
  - Very destructive!
  - While creating the skull rain, mob is unable to attack or move.

- 2 new passive abilities have been added: Permacloak
  - A permacloaked mob is permanently "Cloaked". (Cloak is re-applied every 5 seconds for 5 seconds.)
- The other is Enderport:
  - When an arrow or trident passes near the mob, it warps out of the way to safety.
  - It gains Speed 2 and Strength 1 for 8 seconds when it does, to catch back up to you!

- Finally, mobs with Resistance 5 will create "Invulnerable" pop-ups when attacked, as well as create unique sfx.


Custom Statuses:
- Added a new positive status effect for enemies: "Cloaked"
  - Cloaked makes a mob invisible until the timer runs out.
  - While Cloaked, the mob emits vibrant purple particles around its location.
  - While Cloaked, the mob emits strange ghostly sounds around it. The louder they are, the more cloaked enemies there are nearby.
  - While Cloaked, if the mob takes damage, the duration of Cloaked is reduced by 3 seconds.

- New Option: Independent Difficulty
  - When disabled, (default) Mob Abilities will use the world difficulty to set helper_diff on all players.
  - When enabled, Mob Abilities will ignore world difficulty, allowing a custom value between 1 and 5 to be set.

Changes:

Core:
- Helper Healing functions have been reworked to all use area effect clouds instead of Regeneration effect commands. This makes healing immediate rather than very slightly delayed.
- Helper clouds have received tweaks to ensure they are simultaneously more accurate, and don't have unintended behavior.
- Helper clouds now scale in powers of 2, rather than having a command for each value up to 8. This means any value of healing can be cast on the player by combining the right values.
- Helper clouds exist for 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 healing.

- Helper mob damage now uses a score to deal the damage. Set "damage_queue" equal to the damage you want to deal, and then run the damage command.
- Helper mob damage now takes Absorption into account, and will damage Absorption health first.
- Helper mob damage now takes Resistance 5 into account, and will not do damage if the mob has it.

- Core has additional push functions for knockback events of varying degrees. These are very complex and hard to use outside of Cartographer (you're welcome to try) at least for now.
- Used to apply knockback to a couple new things at different amounts.
- Core now has a "projectile" tag. Currently contains arrows and tridents, and is used to help optimize some functions.

- Cartographer now uses Purple Shulker Boxes for its Shulker Box trick mechanics. This is to help prevent it from causing issues with other mechanics in maps made by other mappers.
  - This change is automatically made on reload. A user should not have to do anything.

Custom Enchantments:

- Adrenaline:
  - Scaling has been adjusted.
    - New scaling is 5 seconds for the first level, 5 seconds for the second level, and one less second per additional level of the enchant.
    - TLDR (5/10/14/17/19/20 seconds) per level.

- Auto Charge:
  - If an Auto Charge Crossbow is already loaded, it will look to load the next one in your hotbar or offhand.

- Current:
  - Instantly recharges your attack time instead of giving Haste 10 for 1 second (on return)
  - Current applies "Stunned" to mobs it is carrying.

- Deadeye:
  - Inflicts small amount of knockback (its hidden version did not)

- Decay:
  - Now has particle effects for hits.

- Duelist:
  - Scaling is now equivalent to Smite and Bane of Arthropods.
  - This means each level provides +2.5 damage to Illager mobs. (2.5/5/7.5/10/12.5)

- Echo:
  - Reworked!
    - Per level, now stores charges of instant attacks.
    - When you hit a mob with an echo weapon, decrease 1 charge.
    - While you have charges, your weapon recharges instantly, and you gain a small amount of knockback resistance.
    - Gain charges back when out of combat.
    - Or gain 1 of them back when you kill a mob.
    - Each level of Echo gives +1 charge. Echo I starts at 2 charges (2/3/4 Echo attacks)
    - Echo charges can be seen in the subtitle space, actionbar space, or hidden entirely.

- Energetic:
  - Scaling has been adjusted.
    - New scaling is 5 seconds for the first level, 5 seconds for the second level, and one less second per additional level of the enchant.
    - TLDR (5/10/14/17/19/20 seconds) per level.

- Eruption:
  - Damage increased to 3 per level. (Scales 3/6/9/12/15)
  - Radius reduced to 8 (was 10).
  - Radius is now centered around the spawner.
  - Now inflicts a small amount of knockback.
  - Now inflicts on hit enchantments when triggered (Fire Aspect, Frostbite, Decay, Overload, Vicious, Committed, Stunning). Thanks ShadowVisions for this suggestion!
  - Improved vfx

- Evasion:
  - When Evasion triggers, enemies within 8 blocks are blinded for 3 seconds.
  - When Evasion triggers, enemies within 8 blocks are knocked back a short distance.
  - Now features a "bias against expectation" system.
    - Each failed trigger of evasion raises the chance of it triggering by 5%. (Capping at 30% additional chance)
    - When Evasion triggers, this counter is reset.
    - You only gain "Evasion Bias" when wearing Evasion gear.
    - This does not increase your Evasion level, it only increases the chance of Evasion successfully triggering over time.

- Evocation:
  - Reworked!
    - Per level, when you kill a mob, create rows of fangs at nearby mobs.
    - Each level creates 1 additional row of fangs at different nearby mobs. (Max of 3 rows of fangs)

- Frenzy:
  - Scaling has been adjusted.
    - New scaling is 5 seconds for the first level, 5 seconds for the second level, and one less second per additional level of the enchant.
    - TLDR (5/10/14/17/19/20 seconds) per level.

- Frostbite:
  - Slowness duration reduced to 4 seconds. (from 5)

- Hunter:
  - Scaling is now equivalent to Smite and Bane of Arthropods.
  - This means each level provides +2.5 damage to Monstrous mobs. (2.5/5/7.5/10/12.5)

- Infinity:
  - Has been recoded from the ground up behind the scenes. (Twice actually)
  - No effective change to the enchant, but hopefully less bugs and weird interactions.

- Lifesteal:
  - Creates sfx and vfx when it triggers.

- Point Blank:
  - Creates sfx and vfx when fired.

- Repeating:
  - No longer duplicates arrows. Consumes and loads only the exact amount of arrows you have in your inventory (or the max it can load)

- Regeneration:
  - Creates vfx when it triggers.

- Repeating:
  - Ammo can be seen in the subtitle space, actionbar space, or hidden entirely.

- Ricochet:
  - Creates actual projectiles which fan out from the base mob, hitting other mobs.
  - Projectiles deal 7 damage each.
  - Projectiles can target and hit the same enemy (and will if there are no other nearby enemies).

- Second Wind:
  - Deals 10 damage to the player. (instead of fireworks)
  - 2nd and 3rd triggers increase the damage by 5. (10/15/20..)
  - 4th and higher triggers do 30 damage. (10/15/20/30/30..)
  - Repeated triggers inflict debuffs. (No Debuff / Slowness I / Slowness I Mining Fatigue I / Slowness I Mining Fatigue I Weakness I...)
  - Second Wind no longer blinds nearby enemies when triggered. (The Evasion hit still does though.)
  - When an enemy is killed, and the user is out of absorption hearts, but have not been killed, the system will instead skip the damage event.
    - This is to prevent awkward interactions where you "killed" an enemy before death, but were still punished for it anyways.
  - Reworked vfx and sfx

- Sharpshot:
  - Creates sfx and vfx when fired.

- Two Handed:
  - Only affects the mainhand item, rather than the hotbar.
  - Item is unbundled when you are no longer holding the Two Handed weapon in your mainhand.
  - Two Handed items can no longer be placed in the offhand.

Developer Commentary:
Adrenaline, Energetic, and Frenzy have all received scaling adjustments to make lower levels feel much more useful.
Eruption damage has been buffed to make it feel more useful, with a slight nerf to its range, and the introduction of knockback to make
its damage feel more normal.
Evasion has received multiple changes to help it feel more impactful.
Second Wind has been given harsher scaling, to prevent it from being powerful when combined with
high defense armor. Now the damage dealt by Second Wind's 4th tier should always execute the player
should they be under 6 health. (assuming unenchanted Diamond or Netherite gear)
Two Handed is intended as a curse effect that denies an inventory slot. In order to make it feel less detrimental, clunky, and restrictive,
it now only applies in your main hand. Additionally, it auto-unbundles items in your offhand when you stop holding it.

Mob Abilities:

Global Overall Changes:
- All mob abilities only work on hostile mobs. While this is a somewhat of a restrictive change, it is being done for performance reasons.
  - All mobs that can use mob abilities are controlled directly by Core's hostile mob tag.
  - You can modify this tag to extend abilities to other mobs, be warned that all Cartographer systems will count them as "hostile".

- The exception to this is Quiver, which now only works on skeleton variants (controlled by the minecraft:skeletons tag)
  - Pillagers and Piglins behave... weirdly with tipped arrows.
  - This is also to help with performance.
  - This will likely be unrestricted when Piglins and Pillagers properly interact with singular tipped arrows.

Augmenter:
  - Improved sfx and vfx.
  - Handbook description no longer incorrectly labels Augmenter buffs as level 1, and now properly labels them as level 2.
  - Augmenter now places Slowness 7 on the mob while charging. (ground based mobs cannot move)

Breaker:
  - No longer breaks spawners.
  - Reworked sfx.

Charge:
  - Uses player location to aim instead of direct forward motion.
  - Deals 10 damage. (Instead of fireworks)

Corpse Crawler:
  - Has variants for zombies, husks, drowned, piglins, zoglins, and bees.

Disarm:
  - Deals 7 damage (instead of using fireworks).

Duplicator:
  - Now works on Piglins, Pillagers, Creepers, Spiders, and Cave Spiders.

Flame Nova:
  - Deals 8 damage. (Instead of fireworks)

Frost Nova:
  - Deals 8 damage. (Instead of fireworks)

Healer:
  - Improved sfx and vfx.
  - Places Slowness 7 on the mob while charging. (ground based mobs cannot move)

Hookshot:
  - Deals 2 damage. (Instead of fireworks)
  - Recoded. Now acts as a projectile.
  - Projectile instantly retracts when it fails to catch a player.
  - When the projectile catches a player, after a brief delay, they are dragged back towards the caster.

Laser:
  - Tracks player location using an armor stand rather than look direction.
  - Laser is more accurate on non-bipedal mobs.
  - Improved vfx and sfx.

Smash:
  - Deals 10 damage. (Instead of fireworks)

Soulfire Nova:
  - Deals 8 damage. (Instead of fireworks)

Sweep:
  - Deals 8 damage. (Instead of fireworks)

Trapper:
  - Clouds now display a unique death message if you die to them.

Venom Nova:
  - Deals 8 damage. (Instead of fireworks)

Webshot:
  - Uses player location to aim instead of direct forward motion.
  - Deals 6 damage. (Instead of fireworks)

Custom Statuses:

Bleeding:
  - Bleeding now only triggers if the mob has no invulnerability frames.
  - Likewise, its duration only decreases if the mob has no invulnerability frames.

Shocked:
  - Shocking only triggers if the mob has no invulnerability frames.
  - Likewise, its duration only decreases if the mob has no invulnerability frames.

Developer Commentary:
Under the new damage system, when multiple damage effects can trigger at the same time, unintended behavior can follow. 
This change is to limit and fix that unintended behavior. Effectively, this also prevents bleed and shocked from
interfering with vanilla minecraft invulnerability frames. 

Bug Fixes and Optimizations:
- New Shulker Boxes for Custom Enchantments to separate Repeating, Auto Charge, and Infinity further. This should eliminate (or at least drastically reduce) the chance of items being replaced improperly.
- Fixed a bug where Repeating only fired the first round of bolts as Multishot, if a Crossbow also had Multishot.
- Fixed potential bugs with Second Wind mis-activating on a newly respawned player.
- Fixed a bug where Infinity did not work on Golden Apples.
- Fixed a bug where Infinity returned the wrong items and overwrote other inventory slots.
- Fixed a bug where Conductive and Rend didn't work more than 160 blocks from 0,0.
- Fixed a bug where Hydraulic left behind permanent marker Armor Stands.
- Fixed a bug where items that were used or broken with Custom Enchantments still "existed" on the player, providing their effects.
- Fixed a bug where custom damage effects did less damage to Wither Skeletons and did not make the damage flash.
- Fixed a bug where multiplayer token systems could cause more than 1 ability to activate at a time.

- About 60 or 70% of the @e calls have been removed from the pack. (Ballparking ~200 separate calls)
  - What does this mean? The pack should perform better under high stress environments.
  - This likely won't be noticeable for casual use, but it should hopefully mean that in extreme cases, Cartographer doesn't affect your tps.
  - This isn't a guarantee Cartographer cannot affect tps; all large datapacks can. But this will help edge cases a bit.

Version Beta 1.1 - The Shock and Awe Update (yeah I'm gonna give updates cutesy names, cause you know, why not)

As an overview, this new version boasts:
+ Almost double the Custom Enchantments on original 1.0 launch. This includes new Trident enchants, new Bow enchants, and more!
+ Multiple new mob abilities to test your mettle against. Soulfire Novas, Fireballs, Traps, and more!
+ Custom Statuses is now an official supported module, with a current total of 6 custom status debuffs that can be applied to mobs!
+ New Enchantments that utilize the mechanics of Custom Statuses.
+ Handbooks for all modules, not just Custom Enchantments!
+ Bugs, there will probably be bugs too. But I've got the bug spray ready.


Detailed Change Log:
Additions:

Custom Statuses is an official module now, instead of a placeholder for the Stunned debuff!
- On the wiki page, its officially clarified you will need Custom Statuses to make any and all custom debuff enchants work properly.
- Added Bleed: A status effect that deals damage over time depending on the level.
  (Applying Bleed to an already Bleeding target increases the level, instead of refreshing the duration.)
- Added Shock: A status effect that deals damage over time, but in a small area around the Shocked target.
- Added Blindness support on enemies. Blindness reduces a mob's follow range by 90%.
- Added Vulnerability. Replacing "Bad Omen" on enemies, Vulnerability increases the damage enemies take from all damage instances by 1 per level.
- Added Rage. After a brief delay, this status effect aggros its victim on the nearest hostile enemy.

- Custom Statuses has an Advancement handbook page titled "Afflictions and Maladies" which details the effects of all custom statuses in game, if you find an item that utilizes them.

Custom Enchantments:
- There are now enchantments that offer compatibility with the new DoT effects in Custom Statuses.
  - Vicious / Rend: Give your melee attacks / arrows the ability to inflict Bleed.
  (Vicious has up to 3 levels, increasing the base duration of Bleed. Rend is single level, with a flat 5 second duration.)
  - Overload / Conductive: Give your melee attacks / arrows the ability to inflict Shocked.
  (Overload has up to 3 levels, increasing duration of Shocked. Conductive is single level, with a flat 5 second duration.)

- Additionally, there are enchantments that offer compatibility with Vulnerability.
  - Committed / Pin Down: Give your melee attacks / arrows Vulnerability.
  (Committed has up to 3 levels, increasing the potency of Vulnerability. Pin Down is a single level, 5 second duration, at Vulnerability II.)

- But that's not all. There are a couple of new melee specific Enchantments:
  - Echo: Striking an enemy has a chance to increase your attack speed briefly by 100%.
    (+20% chance per level to gain 1 second of faster attack speed).
  - Evocation: Killing an enemy has the chance to evoke the wrath of mysterious forces, which claw up from the ground and damage nearby foes.
    (25% increased chance per level, with a maximum of a 75% chance.)
  - Surging Strike: Strike further away from you with a sprint attack, dealing AoE damage in a line past your initial target.
    (+2 damage per level. Surging attacks strike foes that are up to 7 blocks away from the player.)

- There are new general passive Enchantments:
  - Energetic: When killing an enemy, grants Haste for 2 seconds per held/worn level. (Max of 12 seconds)
  - Soulbound: When dropped on death (and not destroyed), this item is immediately returned to your inventory when you respawn.
  - Spurs: When held or worn, walking into a cobweb instantly destroys it (Credit to GavstarB for this idea).

- And a new tool Enchantment:
  - Splintering: This Axe Enchantment causes barrels, doors, and trapdoors you break to stun nearby enemies!

- Bow and Crossbow Enchantments have gotten some new additions, inspired by CTM Community suggestions and Minecraft Dungeons!
  - Frost: Gives your arrows slowing properties.
  - Tempo Theft: Gives your arrows speed stealing properties.
  (Gain Speed when shooting a mob. Gain an increasingly more potent Haste effect at higher levels.)
  - Trueshot: Gives your arrows no gravity.
  - Volatile: Straps fireworks to your arrows to do AoE damage.

- As one final Crossbow addition, Flame now works on Crossbows. Flame on!

- Finally, Tridents have gotten their long needed lineup of Enchantments, besides "just Current".
  - Hydraulic: Trade the long range capabilities of a trident for a close ranged AoE shove attack.
  - Ricochet: Causes a stream of water to bounce from enemy to enemy.
  (Increasing bounce count per level.)
  - Tempest: Increases the damage of ranged throws per level.
  (+3 damage per level.)


Mob Abilities:
- An army of new active attacks join the front lines:
  - Fireball: After a brief channel, the mob creates and directs a fireball projectile towards the nearest player!
  - Soulfire Nova: After a channel, the mob drains the health of all nearby players, healing itself!
  - Trapper: After a brief channel, the mob throws out multiple snaring projectiles behind the player, which slow and hurt those who walk on them!

- There are multiple new death triggering abilities:
  - Spectral: Similar to Exalted foes, killing a Spectral enemy summons a shadowy guardian to take revenge!
    - Spectres are lower (well, than Exalted at least) health assassin type mobs that spawn in with the "Ambush" ability.
  - There are 4 new "Blood" effects. When an enemy with a Blood effect is killed, it applies a buff to nearby enemies!
    - Brutal Blood: Slightly heal nearby foes, and improve their damage.
    (Each slain Brutal foe applies +1 melee damage to nearby foes, up to +5 max)
    - Relentless Blood: Slightly heal nearby foes, and improve their move speed.
    (Each slain Relentless foe applies +10% speed to nearby foes, up to 50% max)
    - Devious Blood: Slightly heal nearby foes, and reset their cooldowns.
    (Enemies without cooldowns receive 10 seconds of Speed I instead)
    - Sacrificial Blood: Slightly heal nearby foes, and give them an Absorption shield.
    (Slain Sacrificial foes grant Absorption I for 60 seconds to nearby foes)
  (All Blood effects heal affected mobs by 4 health)

- Mob Abilities now has an Advancement handbook page titled "Enemy Observations".
- Enemy Observations fills out as you kill mobs with special abilities, detailing special abilities in the handbook page.


Changes:

Custom Enchantments:

- Current now gives a second of hidden Haste 10 when the trident returns to you.
  (This will make the attack cooldown faster when your trident returns, making it easier to hit the mob dragged to you.)

- Sharpshot and Point Blank have received scaling adjustments, as they were considerably outperforming Power.
  - Sharpshot now scales 50%/100%/150% increased damage per second of travel. (Was 100/200/300)
  - Point Blank now scales 70%/140%/210% at close range, reducing as the arrow travels for its first half second. (Was 120/240/360)
  - Point Blank's reduction has been scaled down by 50% (This means that outside of Point Blank's effective range, arrows remain unaffected, just like before).
  - Point Blank's reduction now reduces an arrow's damage up to 10%/20%/30% of Point Blank's effectiveness. (Was 0%/0%/0%).

  - To clarify, Sharpshot and Point Blank increase damage additively, in relation to a Bow's base damage.
  This means that the percentage is unaffected by Power. Power, Sharpshot, and Point Blank, do not affect each other.
  They can be stacked, but they do not increase each other's damage.

- Second Wind has been reworked (again, I swear one day I will get this enchant just right):
  Developer Note: This description of Second Wind is verbose and detailed. The enchantment's new description and a TLDR can be found beneath this list.
  - When you would take a lethal hit [from a mob], force Evasion to trigger.
  - Gain 8 Health in "Volatile Shielding" that lasts for 8 seconds.
  - If you kill a mob, immediately heal for the total remaining shield health. (The shield health will vanish).
  - If the shield health expires (runs out of time or is used up by attacks) it detonates, dealing damage to you and nearby mobs.
  
  - The more times this effect triggers in repeated instances, the less time Volatile Shielding lasts for. (Down to 2 seconds).
  - The more times this effect triggers in repeated instances, the more damage the detonation will do. (Up to 18 damage).

  - New Description:
  "With Evasion, If you would take a fatal hit from a mob, Evasion automatically triggers.
  You are then granted a "Volatile Shield" of 8 health for 8 seconds.
  If you lose that shielding, it detonates, hurting you.
  If you kill a mob, the shielding is defused, and you heal equal to the shielding's total.
  Repeated triggers of Second Wind in succession make the shielding less effective, and more dangerous."

  - TLDR: While the core idea of Second Wind (prolong your life by blocking lethal attack, in exchange for needing to kill mobs to avoid a penalty)
  is the same, the enchant has been streamlined and simplified to make it more responsive and effective.
  A penalty for repeated triggers has been added to prevent the enchantment from making a player immortal.

- Two Handed has been reworked:
  - No longer debuffs the player if an item is held in the offhand and mainhand.
  - Now affects entire hotbar (the curse effect will trigger so long as the Two Handed item is in the hotbar)
  - Two Handed now places an offhand item (while the Two Handed item is in the hotbar) in an "Item Knapsack".
    - The Item Knapsack remains in the offhand. (but can be moved)
    - When right clicked on the ground, the Item Knapsack is opened, placing the item it contains.
    - Items placed by knapsacks Glow, are Indestructible, and don't Despawn (until they are picked up)
    - While inside an Item Knapsack, an item has no effect on the player's stats. (Its enchants will not activate and its attributes will not change the player).
  
  - New Description:
  "When in the hotbar, this item packages and stores up any item placed in your offhand (rendering it ineffective)." 
  
  - TLDR: Two Handed no longer debuffs the player, and instead locks away any item placed in the offhand, preventing it from affecting your stats.

- Curse of Shattering now works on Netherite Items (Tools, Weapons, and Armor).

- The Handbook for Custom Enchantments has been renamed to "Arcane Notes". There have been minor formatting adjustments to the Arcane Notes handbook page.

Mob Abilities:
- Exalted now have properly set attributes. Their "new" stats are:
  - 60 Health
  - 0.26 Movement Speed (Slightly faster than a normal Zombie)
  - 1 Knockback Resistance
  - 12 Attack Damage
  - 40 Follow Range (Same as a normal Zombie)
  - (Exalted still have the "charge" ability).
- Exalted spawn Slowness and Weakness duration reduced to 3 seconds (was 5).
- Nova attack particles have been reworked. Each nova's attack particle will now display a ring of particles around the mob equivalent to the nova's attack range.
- Active Ability animations are now cancelled when a player walks out of range, instead of paused.
- Laser is now far more destructive and dangerous. Make sure to block that line of sight!

- Token Manager Changes:
  - The token manager will not grant a mob a token if they cannot currently see a player. (Active Ability animations will not start if the mob cannot see the player)
    - A mob *can* take a token from a player it is not attacking. But it cannot take a token from a player it could not physically see. (Due to a wall or obstruction)
    - Mobs can take tokens from players they are not directly looking at. (This has always been the case, just to help clarify things.)
    - This does not mean you are immune from attacks through walls. Novas for example will still deal damage to players within radius even if there are blocks obstructing them. (This will likely eventually change).
    - Helper Difficulty (score "helper_diff") now supports up to 5, in case you wanted to involve more panic.

Custom Statuses:
- Mob Abilities' Active Ability animations are now interrupted by the Stunned debuff.

Bug Fixes:
- Fixed Stunned enemies reducing the duration of stun on other stunned enemies.
- Fixed Regeneration not working.
- Fixed Eruption not working.
- Fixed Current not removing drag tag on reeled in enemies. (Current will no longer push mobs away from you.)
- The Shulker Box relied upon to do item manipulation has been moved to 4206900 0 4206900. The chunk containing those coordinates is now constantly loaded.
  (Cartographer Core hopes everyone appreciates this nice meme.)
- Exalted now have properly set attributes. They will be much harder to kill. >:D
- Reflect Shields now properly slow, harden, and sturdify enemies (their attributes now work).

- Credits have been updated and modified to be more specific and accurate.

Hotfix: Version Beta 1.0.1
Bugs Fixed:
- World automatically places Shulker Box at 0 0 0 and sets world spawn there.
(Fixing all enchantments that rely on it, such as Auto Charge, Repeating, and Infinity.)
- Fixed token system for mob abilities not applying statistics to players.
(Active abilities should now work.)
- Fixed Custom Enchantmemts not creating "helper_arrow_dmg" scoreboard on reload.
(Sharpshot and Point Blank work again).

Thanks to Matt_97 and Gizmo for finding these bugs!
